## 1. Environment Setup

### 1.1 Install Development Tools
- **Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Install from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/).
- **AWS CLI**: Install following instructions at [AWS CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).
- **Git**: Install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### 1.2 Set Up Version Control
- Create a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub) and clone it locally.
  
### 1.3 Configure AWS
- Create an **AWS S3 bucket** for file storage.
- Generate AWS IAM credentials with S3 access.
- Configure AWS CLI using the provided credentials.

## 2. Repository Structure & Layers
Your project is organized as a single repository (mono repo) with clearly defined layers, ensuring separation of concerns and clarity during development.

### 2.1 **Repository Layout**

```plaintext
/my-app                          # Root project folder (Monorepo)

## 3. Backend Development

### 3.1 Initialize the Backend Project
1. Run `npm init` within the `/backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies (Express.js, AWS SDK, PostgreSQL client, bcrypt, JWT, etc.).

### 3.2 Build the Express.js Server
1. Create a server file (`server.js`) to initialize Express.
2. Define and configure API routes for:
   - Authentication: Login, logout, and JWT token generation.
   - File Management: Upload, download, rename, and delete operations.
   - Folder Operations: Create and organize folders.

### 3.3 Configure PostgreSQL
1. Set up the database using scripts in `/database/migrations`.
2. Create models in `/backend/models` for:
   - Users
   - Files (storing metadata such as file size, S3 URL, etc.)
   - Folders
   - Logs (for auditing)

### 3.4 Implement Authentication and Security
1. Secure user passwords with bcrypt.
2. Use JWT for secure, stateless session management.
3. Protect API routes with middleware (located in `/backend/middlewares`).

### 3.5 Implement File Handling & S3 Integration
1. Develop the service in `/backend/services/s3-service.js` to:
   - Handle multipart uploads for very large files.
   - Manage resumable downloads and generate signed URLs.
   - Communicate with AWS S3 using the AWS SDK.

## 4. Frontend Development (Next.js with Tailwind CSS)

### 4.1 Initialize the Frontend Project
1. Use `npx create-next-app` within the `/frontend` directory.
2. Install Tailwind CSS and configure it for styling.

### 4.2 Build Authentication & User Interface
1. Develop a Login Page to capture user credentials.
2. Securely handle the JWT token (store in local storage or cookies).
3. Create a Dashboard where users can:
   - Upload and download files.
   - View file metadata.
   - Preview files using signed URLs.

### 4.3 Implement File Management UI
1. Create components for:
   - File Upload/Download
   - File List Display with options to rename or delete.
   - Folder Management (create, rename, organize).
2. Enhance UX with loading indicators and progress bars for large file transfers.

## 5. AWS S3 Integration (Storage Layer)

### 5.1 Configure AWS S3
1. Finalize S3 bucket setup and policies.
2. Document S3 configuration in `/storage/s3-config.js`.

### 5.2 Implement Robust File Transfers
1. In the backend S3 service:
   - Use multipart uploads to split large files.
   - Ensure resumable transfers to handle network issues.
   - Generate signed URLs for secure file previews and downloads.

## 6. Deployment on AWS (On-Demand Execution)

### 6.1 Overall Deployment Considerations
1. All application components (frontend, backend, and database) will be deployed in AWS.
2. Since the app is used only on-demand (specifically by you), it doesn't need to run perpetually.
3. Consider using cost-effective, on-demand computing services.

### 6.2 Deployment Components

#### Backend Deployment
1. Containerization: Package the backend as a container (using Docker) and deploy on AWS ECS Fargate or use AWS Lambda for serverless on-demand execution.
2. On-Demand Execution: Configure the backend to scale down (or be invoked on request) to run only when needed.
3. Environment Configuration: Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager to handle environment variables securely.

#### Frontend Deployment
1. Deploy the Next.js app using AWS Amplify, AWS S3 with CloudFront, or a similar static hosting solution.
2. Configure the hosting to ensure the frontend is available on-demand (it can remain static while API calls are made only when required).

#### Database Deployment
1. Host PostgreSQL on AWS RDS.
2. Set up backups and configure the instance size based on expected usage (since usage is intermittent, you can opt for a smaller instance to reduce costs).

#### Integration & Domain
1. Route 53 is used for domain name management and SSL certificate provisioning via AWS Certificate Manager.
2. Ensure that API endpoints and frontend resources are integrated seamlessly.

## 7. Testing & Optimization

### 7.1 Testing
1. Authentication: Verify login and token functionality. 
2. File Operations: Test uploads/downloads (especially large file transfers).
3. Layer Interaction: Validate the communication between frontend, backend, database, and AWS S3.
4. On-Demand Execution: Ensure that the backend properly spins up when needed and shuts down when idle.

### 7.2 Optimization
1. Use CDN caching (CloudFront) for static assets.
2. Optimize database queries and file transfer methods. 
3. Monitor performance using AWS CloudWatch and adjust resource allocation accordingly.

### 7.3 Maintenance
1. Set up logging for API requests and file operations.
2. Regularly review and update security settings and dependencies.
3. Schedule periodic testing, especially for the on-demand deployment aspects.
